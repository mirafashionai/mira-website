        <p>Mira is an AI-powered personal stylist and smart closet assistant. This policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when users interact with our app or connect third-party accounts such as Pinterest.</p>

            <li>Pinterest data that users explicitly grant us access to (such as boards and pins)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
